Newly update features üöÄ
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


#. 
   Eventually, we have support **hierachical configuration**. So, you can define hierachical config (beyond two-level) with **toml-like** section. Easy_configer now support this feature and convert your hierachical declearation into the hierachical dict structure. Have a look at documentation!!

#. 
   Along with the new feature : hierachical config, we also support the **commend-line override** with any value declared in any layer of config!! it's not easy, but we did it www. Have a look at documentation!!

#. 
   **Config merging mechnaism** is a common technique in dynamic configuration. So, we also support config merging in this version!! yeah ~ feel free to merg, concat, and then override the config to make your python program more controllable!!
