Meta information
==================

Newly update features üöÄ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*I have took sometime to accept the truth those famous config-tools have the support from their community and eco-system. For example, torchlightning's Trainer take argparse as input; fb hydra take omegaconf as input.*
**So, easy_configer now provide a converter mechnaism allowing user convert our easy_config into the other famous config-tools (s.t. argparse, omegaconf, and yaml).**
